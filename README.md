# ClicktoChangeBoost

I made an app with c# that changes the cpu boost mode. you should firstly look at other repository called "ClosingCpuBoost" in my page. you see there the .bat file.

This app uses this bat file to close/open cpu boost mode.

If you run the app it appears in the taskbar. 

With double click you can change the boost mode.
